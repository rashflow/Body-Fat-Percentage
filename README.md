# Body-Fat-Percentage Mesurement

The accurate methods of measuring body fat involves methods which are often expensive or cumbersome. In this project we tried to arrive at a simple mathematical model for measuring body fat percentage by measurement of different body parts. The measuremets involve measuring body parts at different sites throughout the body, whether at the joints or between the joints.

### Where is it useful?
In large scale studies where very high accuracy may not be the priority. Rather it is important to know the trend in the long term. It should also be cheap so that the cost of running an experiment is low.
